SomethingMagnificent
====================

! Still needs a lot of tweaking !

Vim colorscheme file for SomethingMagnificent.

Colorschemes hinge on syntax files, and this file should work with builtin syntax definitions wherever possible. 

Tested with the following syntax files:
  
  .vim
  
  .md

  .conf

Confirmed as needing adjustment:
  
  .cpp // Some adjustment for easier reading needed 

  .html

Version
-------
1.01 - .conf files look all right (apache2 .conf files)

1.0 - Created basic palette. Few bugs, but looks mostly ok (vim + md files)
