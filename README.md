SomethingMagnificent
====================

Colorscheme file for Something Magnificent.

Colorschemes hinge on syntax files, and this file should work with builtin syntax definitions wherever possible. 

Tested with the following syntax files:
  
  .vim
  .md

Confirmed as needing adjustement:

  .html

Version
-------
1.0 - Created basic palette. Few bugs, but looks mostly ok (vim + md files)
